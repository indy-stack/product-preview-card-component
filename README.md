## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This is the second challenge that I do from Frontend Mentor and althought this one is similar to the first challenge I put in practice the use of min/max height and width, along with relative units like vh(view height) and vw(wiew width) in order to make my design responsive. I'm definitely getting better with positioning the elements in the page and planning ahead for design responsiveness.

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Continued development

I'd like to continue working on all the flex properties available to make my designs even more responsive.
